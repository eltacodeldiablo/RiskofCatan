## Placing starting armies ##

- For each starting settlement/city, after placing your road/ship you also place one army on an adjacent unoccupied hex.
- If all nearby hexes are occupied, you may battle for the territory.
- However, the army placed first is on defense.
- After all settlements are placed, starting with the second player, all players take turns placing armies on unoccupied hexes, including the desert tile (but not water tiles) until all land tiles are occupied.
- As per Risk rules, army placement follows a simple loop: 2nd player, 3rd player, 4th player, 1st player, 2nd player, etc. Do not "snake back" like you do for settlement/city placement.

## Territory occupation vs control ##

- **Occupy** - You are said to occupy a territory (hex) if you have at least one standing army in the hex.
- **Control** - You are said to control a territory (hex) if you have a number of armies equal to or greater than the number of pips on the territory's number token. For example, the Catan chit labeled "6" has 5 pips under the number, so you need five or more armies on that territory to fully control it. The Catan chit labeled "11" only requires 2 armies to control it.
- Deserts, and lands labeled "2" and "12" are controlled by any single army.

## Controlling settlements/cities ##

- You control an enemy settlement or city when you control all adjacent land territories.
- The controlling player gets the victory points, resources, and harbors as if they had built it.
- The original player loses the victory points, resource gathering, and use of the harbor until it is recaptured.
- Note that all adjacent territories need to be controlled by the same player to have control of the settlement or city.
- You may maintain control of a settlement/city even if one enemy controls 2 of your home territories and another enemy player controls your 3rd home territory.
- The original building player can still build armies from the settlement/city to try to break occupation/control so long as the city is not captured.
- The armies are placed on one adjacent hex of the original players choice, they are immediately on offense, and cannot retreat anywhere.

## Controlling roads ##

- You control an enemy road when you control all land territories that have that road as an edge.
- Captured roads prevent the transport of troops, unless the controlling player agrees to allow it through negotiation or trade.
- Roads can be freed via battle.

## Buying and recruiting armies ##

- To buy armies, during the building phase you declare a resource type. You receive one army per resource of that type that you pay to the bank.
- You cannot change resource types until next turn. For example, 4 armies would cost 4 ore, 4 wheat, 4 lumber, 4 brick, OR 4 sheep, but you may not mix and match.
- Each turn, you are limited to buying one army per victory point that you have. For example, if you have 6 victory points, you may buy up to 6 armies that turn. (See Army unit type for full cost rules)
- Armies must be placed adjacent to villages or cities.

## Army movement and battle ##

- Armies are placed on hexes, they move, attack, and defend according to Risk battle rules. However unlike risk troops must be situated in the same space as the people they are attacking unless otherwise specified (look at unit types).
- Also a minimum of one troop staying behind like Risk does not exist. Armies may only move one space unless it is the cavalry unit (look at unit types). One cannot move through roads that are controlled by other players unless negotiated.
- At the end of your turn, you may redeploy as many troops as you desire from one hex to any other hex, as long as there is a complete path of supply lines and trade routes connecting them. Troops may only move through spaces directly adjacent to roads/villages/cities. 

## Army unit types ##

### Foot soldier ###

- **Cost**: 1 resource
- **Description**: Normal foot soldier that can only move one space per turn.

### Cavalry ###

- **Cost**: 2 resources
- **Description**: Troops on horses that can move two spaces per turn and also has an attack bonus of 1 against foot soldiers but loses the defensive bonus given in risk when attacked by foot soldiers. 

### Cannon ###

- **Cost**: 3 resources
- **Description**: Has a range of 2 and can barrage an army. Roll a dice if 1-3 then it's a miss. If 4-6 hits. Roll again (1-2 = 1 kill, 3-4 = 2 kills, 5-6 = 3 kills). Can only attack once per turn. If enemy army enters into the same space as cannon and there is no other unit protecting it, the enemy automatically destroys the cannon. can move one space as long as there is a foot soldier occupying that space. Cannot be used if the residing space is under attack. Enemies must be at least one space away. 

## Elimination and Endgame ##

- Occasionally, players may be eliminated from the game, but this does not happen every game.
- If a player needs to leave the game, they are simply eliminated as if they were defeated in combat.
- However, if a player is eliminated when they do not have control over any settlements or cities then the eliminator takes control of all their buildings and roads. All their troops are, however, eliminated from the game.
- If they leave, however, the eliminated player leaves all of their troops on the board, acting as defenders of the territories until they are defeated. They do not get any bonuses for controlling territories and cannot be moved. Any player may roll defense dice for the removed player.
- Any eliminated player's resource cards are returned to the resource bank.
- All of the eliminated player's development cards are shuffled back into the development card deck.
- First player to 10 or more points (on their turn) wins. In the event that multiple players meet or exceed 10 points, the first player to still have 10 or more during their turn is declared the winner.
